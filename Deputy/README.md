### Description
The Deputy smart contract is responsible for making proposals on behalf of Carta Studio, the owner of the smart contract. Currently, only this smart contract is able to make proposals. However, once the Carta DAO members have a better understanding of the correct process for making proposals, a vote will be held to determine if the restriction should be lifted and all eligible members allowed to make proposals.

The Deputy contract also includes an ERC-20 compatible token with DEX functionality that may be used in a later stage of the project.
